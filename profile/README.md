# Metadata for Wearables â€“ Light loggers, actigraphs, and more

This organization houses the code and metadata for the **Metadata4Wearables** project. The project grew out of independent efforts of group of researchers interested in standardising and harmonising actigraphy data (the "Chronobiology Data Standards Interest Group", abbreviated as CDSIG) and the [Daylight Academy](https://daylight.academy/) Group [The role of daylight for humans](https://daylight.academy/projects/state-of-light-in-humans/) with the goal to harmonise metadata for light exposure data.

The efforts presented here are work in progress and are not to be considered final. We invite contributions.
